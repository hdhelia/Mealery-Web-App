# Innovative idea
Our project is a web app that provides students and other people, who don't have the time to cook meals, with monthly meal plans from local restaurants. So, it provides a platform that connects restaurants with a huge number of orders and people with delicious meals guaranteed in a timely manner.\
This will be very useful for college students living off campus like us, because during the pandemic, we quickly realized that cooking and getting groceries can be a drag and waste of precious, potentially productive time. So, with everyone working from home and staying in, this product could ease a lot of stress and save huge amounts of time\
Another reason, we love this idea is the huge amount of support small businesses, from grocery stores and restaurants to farms and other stakeholders, could receive with a guaranteed stream of revenue\
